## Active JavaScript Ownership

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `js/app.js` | Main logged-in app: auth, Supabase load, stats, filters, voter modal, and save logic. |
| `js/config.js` | Supabase URL/key, table name, login users, shared-page helpers. |
| `js/read-view-public.js` | Allows `view=read` dashboard/voters links to open without username/password while keeping the app read-only. |
| `js/assign-share.js` | Creates short public self-assign links and the Copy/Open share panel. |
| `js/dashboard-cleanup.js` | UI polish, share selection tools, modal guard, and top-house helpers. Its old startup interval has been removed. |
| `js/d2d-count-fix.js` | Keeps D2D count labels aligned with D2D status. |
| `js/house-sync.js` | House dropdown, Dhafthar/Sinamale grouping, Top Houses. |
| `js/house-filter-lock.js` | Keeps selected house/search active while filtering or saving. |
| `js/no-jump-fixes.js` | Loads before cleanup/hotfix scripts; removes late old Assign stats and saves the old hotfix popup without `location.reload()`. |
| `js/pro-ui.js` | Clean card actions, Assign focus, View Profile button, visible meta cleanup; scheduled with `requestAnimationFrame`, not intervals. |
| `js/save-state-fix.js` | Preserves selected filter/search/house/scroll when lists rebuild, capped at 3 restore attempts. |
| `js/voter-card-statuses.js` | Voter card status display cleanup. |
| `js/voter-hotfix.js` | Legacy popup/save layer still loaded, but guarded by `no-jump-fixes.js`. |

## Legacy / Disabled JavaScript

| File | Current Role |
|---|---|
| `js/voter-final-cleanup.js` | Disabled compatibility shim. |
| `js/dhafthar-force-filter.js` | Disabled compatibility shim. House logic is in `house-sync.js`. |
| `js/house-click-filter.js` | Disabled compatibility shim. Top-house clicks belong to `house-sync.js`. |
| `js/assign-filter.js` | Legacy assignment filter helper. Not currently loaded. |
| `js/house-dropdown-group.js` | Legacy dropdown helper. |
| `js/zero-day.js` | Legacy Zero Day logic. |

## Important Current Behavior

| Feature | Rule |
|---|---|
| Share Read View | Opens with `view=read` and should not ask for username/password. |
| Voter card chips | Keep the chips such as Reached, Will Vote, Need Call, Normal. |
| Bottom duplicate result row | Removed from voter cards. Do not re-add duplicate Will Vote at the bottom. |
| Voters stats | Do not inject Assign stat late after page load; it causes layout jump. Duplicate old Assign stats are hidden by `voters-stats.css` and removed by `no-jump-fixes.js`. |
| Save from middle of list | Must not refresh the page or jump to the top. |
| House filter | Must stay selected after saving or changing voter status. |
| Self-assign link | Friends tick/untick voters, write name/mobile only when needed, then save. |
| Assignment privacy | Shared links do not show other assignee names. |
| Dhafthar/Sinamale | House grouping belongs to `house-sync.js`. |

## Update Log

|---|---|

| 2026-07-06 | Bumped `js/dashboard-cleanup.js` to `v=20260706-27` on dashboard/voters. |
| 2026-07-06 | Added `js/read-view-public.js` so Share Read View links open without login while staying read-only. |
| 2026-07-06 | Removed `js/top-house-stabilizer.js` from dashboard/voters script tags to avoid conflicts. |
| 2026-07-06 | Limited `js/save-state-fix.js` restore attempts to 3 tries max. |

| 2026-07-06 | Loaded `js/no-jump-fixes.js` before `dashboard-cleanup.js` so old hotfix behavior is guarded before it starts. |
| 2026-07-06 | Changed `js/pro-ui.js` scheduling to `requestAnimationFrame` instead of timer-style enhancement. |
| 2026-07-06 | Updated `css/voters-stats.css` to hide duplicate old Assign stats and keep the stats strip stable. |
| 2026-07-06 | Removed duplicate bottom voter-card result row while keeping the status chips. |
| 2026-07-06 | Added public self-assign flow with short links, name/mobile validation, tick/untick, and privacy rules. |
| 2026-07-05 | Organized CSS into `css/` and JavaScript into `js/`. |

## Rules For Future Updates

| Feature Area | Put Logic Here |
|---|---|
| Main data, stats, filters, modal save | `js/app.js` |
| Public read-only dashboard links | `js/read-view-public.js` |
| House dropdown, Dhafthar/Sinamale, Top Houses | `js/house-sync.js` |
| House/filter/scroll after save | `js/house-filter-lock.js` and `js/save-state-fix.js` |
| Stop old hotfix jumps/reloads | `js/no-jump-fixes.js` |
| Self-assign links | `js/assign-share.js` and `shared.html` |
| Voter card actions and visual cleanup | `js/pro-ui.js` and `css/voter-list-cards.css` |
| Popup card layout | `css/voter-popup-card.css` |

Do not add a second owner for save, filter, house grouping, or voter-card rendering. Update this README after important changes.
